**Welcome to LeagueBot!**

Leaguebot will let you administer your Overwatch league all from the comfort of your Discord server, so you can play more and manage spreadsheets less.

If you're just setting up LeagueBot, try running `!leaguebot configure`

LeagueBot has the following commands:

• !divisions
• !teams
• !scores

Run any of them to see more help on how they work.
