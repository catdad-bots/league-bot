LeagueBot
=================

Leaguebot will let you administer your Overwatch league all from the comfort of your Discord server, 
so you can play more and manage spreadsheets less.

# Setup

[Invite](https://bit.ly/2WcQEqt) LeagueBot to your league's discord server. 

LeagueBot is built to support leagues that run out of two discord servers (one for Admin, one for Players) or a single shared server. 
If you use two servers, invite LeagueBot to both.

Follow the instructions provided by `!leaguebot configure` to finish setting up your league.


# Commands

- !divisions
- !teams
- !scores

To learn how a command works, just ask it for help. For example: `!divisions help`
